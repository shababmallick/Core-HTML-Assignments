                        interactivity and dynamic behavior to

                        reload the page.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript is used to interact with and 
                        modify the Document Object Model (DOM),
                         which represents the structure of a 
                         webpage. This enables the creation of
                          dynamic and responsive web applications.
                        </li>
                    <li>JavaScript can make requests to servers
                         (using techniques like AJAX or Fetch API)
                          to retrieve data and update parts of a

                            JavaScript is often used to validate 
                            form inputs on the client side, providing instant
                             feedback to users.
